<h2>Introduction to Vanlife</h2>

<br>

<p>
Welcome to the site! You may be wondering what "Vanlife" is, and maybe you've heard about it
on the news or from a friend. Vanlife refers to the mobile lifestyle where people choose to 
live in vans, usually cargo vans, that have been converted into living spaces to enable a life
of travel and financial freedom.

<br>
<br>

On this site, you'll discover all the information you ever wanted about the Vanlife lifestyle,
and even some advice on how to start a lifestyle like that for yourself if you so choose.

<br><br>

Enjoy your stay!

<h4>What Is Vanlife?</h4>

<p>Put simply, Vanlife is the practice of living full-time in a van, not unlike what full-time RVers do. Typically, those who practice this lifestyle purchase their own vans and then
customize them to be suitable for full-time living, which in some cases can include elaborate sleeping areas, kitchens, and an entire electrical system.</p>
<p>Vanlifers sometimes embrace a nomadic lifestyle, traveling frequently from place to place, while others pursue a more stationary existence, staying primarily at campgrounds and parks.</p>

<br>

<p>Although not universal, usually Vanlifers pursue remote forms of work, often working from home within their vans to make a living. This combined with the low cost of living creates a very
flexible lifestyle as well as a good work-life balance.</p>
<p>Vanlifers say that some of the advantages of living in a van over an RV is that it's easier to park a van in most places, including cities, as well as the fact that a van can be completely
customized from the inside-out to meet your liking, whereas RVs are usually pre-designed and less customizable.</p>
<p>Whatever their personal preferences are, though, it can't be denied that the Vanlife lifestyle is on the rise, with more people considering living in a van than ever before.</p>
<br>

<h5>Van Construction</h5>

<p>Vans, or camper vans, as they are sometimes known, are constructed in a variety of different ways for Vanlife. Typically cargo vans are used as the base model for most camper van builds,
but this is by no means a concrete rule, and vans of all kinds have been used to construct camper vans, even school buses in some cases. Most builds are going to incorporate basic living
amenities, which can include portable toilets, kitchens, kitchen appliances, and so on, with each interior build being customized for the user's personal needs.

<br>
<br>
<p>As far as cost is concerned, Vanlife builds can be as cheap as $3,000 and as much as $100,000, depending on the type of van and how luxurious the interior ends up being. One of the advantages
is that the cost can be whatever the builder wants it to be, giving Vanlifers a great degree of flexibility in terms of budget.</p>

<p>Vans often use unconvential power systems as well, sometimes using hookup systems, and other times using solar panels and other forms of alternative energy. Internet is usually obtained
through remote hotspot devices, either standalone in nature or being granted via a mobile phone.</p>

<br>

<h6>Why You Should Consider This Lifestyle</h6>

<p>While Vanlife isn't for everyone, the lifestyle does have a lot of advantages for those seeking a more freeing and mobile lifestyle that allows for regular travel.</p>
